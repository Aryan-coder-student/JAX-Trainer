# 🚀 JAX-Trainer: Stack Overflow QA Scraper for JAX

**JAX-Trainer** is an automated tool for scraping high-quality **JAX-related** questions and answers from Stack Overflow. It uses GitHub Actions to continuously fetch and update a dataset of developer discussions — perfect for building **coding assistants**, **RAG systems**, or fine-tuning **LLMs** on real-world queries.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Scrapes JAX-tagged questions (`jax`, `jaxlib`) from Stack Overflow
- ✅ Filters questions with accepted answers
- ✅ Automatically runs daily with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Stores results in `jax_questions.json` (overwrite/update mode)
- ✅ Ideal for RAG training, NLP pipelines, and LLM fine-tuning

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. `script.py` queries Stack Overflow for top JAX questions.
2. Each question is matched with its answers.
3. GitHub Actions (`python-app.yml`) runs this script daily.
4. Output is saved in `jax_questions.json`.

## 🧪 Example Data Format

```json
{
  "title": "Why is array manipulation in JAX much slower?",
  "question": "I'm trying to optimize matrix operations...",
  "answers": [
    "JAX uses lazy evaluation and XLA compilation, which might delay execution...",
    "Try replacing in-place operations with functional ones to benefit from JIT..."
  ]
}

## 🛠️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JAX-Trainer.git
cd JAX-Trainer
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if applicable
python script.py
```

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions

The automated workflow is located in:

```
.github/workflows/python-app.yml
```

It:

* Runs `script.py` on a schedule (daily/weekly)
* Commits the latest scraped data
* Keeps your dataset continuously fresh

> 🔐 Make sure to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for push access in GitHub Actions if you're committing updates.

## 📈 Use Cases

* 🎯 Fine-tune LLMs on real developer Q\&A
* 🧠 Build retrieval-based coding assistants
* 🤖 Train JAX-specific Copilot tools
* 📊 Analyze developer pain points in the JAX ecosystem
